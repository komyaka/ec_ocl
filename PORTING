OpenCL port: TODO
------------------

starting from https://github.com/masterzorag/ec_pure_c code, now we need to run ideally N point multiplication by scalar in parallel.

code needs to respect OpenCL 1.1 specification: http://www.khronos.org/registry/cl/specs/opencl-1.1.pdf
avoid AMD/CUDA specific implementation about threads/wavefronts and friends, again: OpenCL standard 1.1

I can test OpenCL code on:

	1. Accelerator Cell B.E. with IBM OpenCL implementation:
	add OpenCL query result

	2. AMD E-350 / HD6310 with Mesa OpenCL implementation:
	check clinfo.PALM


bn_* functions uses a fixed length of 20 item, use a define and hardcode lenght

alignment, %128 bits, each * 16 byte is good

address space: write data struct for _constant and _local

ideally _local address space is faster, use this where needed data reuse
